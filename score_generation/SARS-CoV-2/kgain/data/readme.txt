Detailed procedure:
The SARS-CoV-2 dataset were acquired from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) EpiCoV database. As of August 29, 2022, this repository encompasses a comprehensive compilation of 12,893,684 genomic sequences. Notably, 0.5 million (477,667) genome sequences were selectively retrieved based on stringent criteria, specifically Human as host, complete genome, excluded low coverage, with patient status and collection date from 1st Jan, 2010 to 29th Aug, 2022. The comprehensive dataset encompasses a global representation, spanning virtually all nations, and is available in both FASTA and TSV formats. The FASTA file contains COVID sequences with unique identifiers, while the TSV file provides metadata elucidating critical attributes. Genome-wide variant identification and open reading frame (ORF) prediction were executed using GISAID COVID FASTA files, employing a meticulous multi-step analytical approach that integrated the StrainFlow (rintukutum/strainflow_manuscript and CoV-Seq pipelines. Reference sequences for COVID-19 (NC_045512.2) sourced from NCBI were employed for genome annotation within Cov-Seq pipeline. This comprehensive analysis yielded multiple distinct data categories with 68,364 unique mutations encompassing distinct genomic regions collectively encapsulated within FASTA files, including orf.tsv, snpeff.tsv, snpeff.vcf, and orf.vcf files to provide a comprehensive representation of variants. Among the 69,152 unique mutations initially identified, 788 were excluded due to the presence of common variants spanning multiple genes. Consequently, the dataset was refined to encompass 68,364 mutations among which 56,971 were identified as unique SNPs which were employed as input for the flank generation.  The kGain score was computed exclusively for 56,942 SNPs using the Kaos package, thus excluding 29 variants from the analysis due to kGain flanking values not exceeding 10 bp. Following the computation, 54,085 mutations were retained for further analysis after filtering out variants lacking protein variant names (HGVS_P).
