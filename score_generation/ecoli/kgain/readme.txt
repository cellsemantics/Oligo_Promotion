Steps to reproduce:

1. First run the <Code_for_flanks.R> script to acquire the flank and save it in m<i>_annotated_timecourse.xlsx, where i denotes the population number.
2. Next, execute <gain generation from flank.ipynb> to calculate the kGain for each unique mutation. In the script, the kGain is referred to as accumulated_gain.
