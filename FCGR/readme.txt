1. all species FCGR generation.ipynb: This script generates FCGR from fasta files of species. We save the final resultant data frame in the file named all species FCGR in -log(x) scale truncated to four decimel.txt and then compress it for future use.

2. all speceies FCGR in -log(x) scale truncated to four decimel.tar.xz: It contains the data file required plot for FCGR plotting. Please extract the compressed file before using it. The file is obtained from the notebook all speceies FCGR generation.ipynb and saved for later use.

3. individual fcgr density plot and heatmap.ipynb: This file contains the notebook for FCGR density plots of kmer and heatmap.
