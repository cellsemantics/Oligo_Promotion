Detailed procedure:
The SARS-CoV-2 dataset were acquired from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) EpiCoV database. As of August 29, 2022, this repository encompasses a comprehensive compilation of 12,893,684 genomic sequences. Notably, 0.5 million (477,667) genome sequences were selectively retrieved based on stringent criteria, specifically Human as host, complete genome, excluded low coverage, with patient status and collection date from 1st Jan, 2010 to 29th Aug, 2022. The comprehensive dataset encompasses a global representation, spanning virtually all nations, and is available in both FASTA and TSV formats. The FASTA file contains COVID sequences with unique identifiers, while the TSV file provides metadata elucidating critical attributes. Genome-wide variant identification and open reading frame (ORF) prediction were executed using GISAID COVID FASTA files, employing a meticulous multi-step analytical approach that integrated the StrainFlow (rintukutum/strainflow_manuscript and CoV-Seq pipelines. Reference sequences for COVID-19 (NC_045512.2) sourced from NCBI were employed for genome annotation within Cov-Seq pipeline. This comprehensive analysis yielded multiple distinct data categories with 68,364 unique mutations encompassing distinct genomic regions collectively encapsulated within FASTA files, including orf.tsv, snpeff.tsv, snpeff.vcf, and orf.vcf files to provide a comprehensive representation of variants. Among the 69,152 unique mutations initially identified, 788 were excluded due to the presence of common variants spanning multiple genes. Consequently, the dataset was refined to encompass 68,364 mutations among which 56,971 were identified as unique SNPs which were employed as input for the flank generation.  The kGain score was computed exclusively for 56,942 SNPs using the Kaos package, thus excluding 29 variants from the analysis due to kGain flanking values not exceeding 10 bp. Following the computation, 54,085 mutations were retained for further analysis after filtering out variants lacking protein variant names (HGVS_P). The assessment of mutational virulence involves the scrutiny of mutation frequency, lineage information, variant classification information and LLR score. The requisite mutation counts for each variant were sourced from the Python Outbreak.info API package. The computation of mutation frequency was achieved for 54075 SNPs by dividing the mutation counts by the cumulative sum of all mutation counts within a gene. However, 10 SNPs did not receive any mutation count from the API. Lineage data sourced from the Python Outbreak.info API encompassed 334 variants, each associated with specific lineage information such as alpha, beta, gamma, delta, omicron, b.1.2, lambda, and mu. The integration of lineage data with the kGain score dataset resulted in the identification of 144 mutations, each accompanied by their corresponding scores. These 144 variants were subsequently categorized into VOC and VOI, and the remaining variants were designated as Controls in accordance with WHO guidelines for COVID classification. TSV and ORF files encompassing 56,971 unique SNPs obtained from the SNP calling phase were consolidated, and relevant columns were extracted from the amalgamated files. Redundancy was meticulously addressed at each procedural step to ensure data integrity and consistency. Solely missense variants were encompassed within the purview of this analysis, with synonymous mutations, upstream, downstream, start_lost, and transcript_ablation variants being systematically excluded from the datasets due to truncated proteins. Subsequently, protein variant files originating from SNP calling and LLR output files were aligned utilizing a unique SNP identifier, thereby facilitating the retrieval of the LLR scores into the protein variant file and resulting in 22156 missense variants.
